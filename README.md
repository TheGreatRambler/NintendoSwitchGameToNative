# NOTE: This project is impossible until the Remill project implements a few ARMv8 instructions, and as such this project is put on hold

# NintendoSwitchGameToNative
A complicated set of theoretical steps to compile any Switch game for any other platforms. NOTE: The process took approximately 5 hours and 12 gigabytes of memory for Super Mario Maker 2, a relatively small switch game. The process may appear to freeze at some points, but this is expected.

# Handling API calls
SwIPC has many API calls but they are not documented. Plenty of other resources across the web document them in more detail, like Skyline for SSBU.
